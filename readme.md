# futhor

Chrome extension that enhances the FUT (Fifa Ultimate Team) web app.

---

**WIP**

## Installation

## Description

Futhor is a Chrome extension I did last year, that hopefully still works. It
enhances the web app with a new tab (in the left menu).

More documentation to come soon.

## Features

---

## Dev

Here's how to build the extension

    npm install
    npm run gulp

It'll create a `futhor-build` directory you can then use with `chrome://extensions`.

Later on, when stable and up to date, release builds should be available to download.
